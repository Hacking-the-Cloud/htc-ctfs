# CICDont
An AWS/GitLab CI/CD themed CTF.

## NOTE
This project will deploy intentionally vulnerable software/infrastructure to your AWS account. Please ensure there is no sensitive or irrecoverable data in the account. Attempts have been made to mitigate this however they may not be fullproof; Security Group rules only allow access to the vulnerable EC2 instance from your public IP address, and a randomly generated password is required to access it.
